## ⚙️ Core Modules Description

* **`app.py`**: The entry point of the Streamlit application. Handles overall page structure, navigation, and initializes global settings.
* **`config.py`**: Contains application-level configurations, such as API keys (though preferably use `.env`), default parameters, and settings.
* **`data_processing.py`**: Manages all aspects of data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis and display.
* **`calculations.py`**: Houses the functions for performing various financial and trading-specific calculations (e.g., P&L, win rate, Sharpe ratio).
* **`kpi_definitions.py`**: Defines the logic and calculation for various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used throughout the dashboard.
* **`plotting.py`**: Contains functions to generate various plots and charts (e.g., equity curves, performance heatmaps) using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.
* **`ai_models.py` & `services/ai_model_service.py`**: Define and manage the AI/ML models used for predictions or advanced analytics.
* **`stochastic_models.py` & `services/stochastic_model_service.py`**: Implement and manage stochastic models.
* **`statistical_methods.py` & `services/statistical_analysis_service.py`**: Provide functions for various statistical tests and analyses.
* **`components/`**: Contains reusable Streamlit components that are used across multiple pages to maintain a consistent UI/UX.
* **`services/`**: Encapsulates business logic for different analytical domains, acting as a bridge between UI pages and core computation/data modules.
* **`utils/logger.py`**: Configures the logging mechanism for the application, helping in debugging and tracking events.
* **`utils/common_utils.py`**: A collection of general-purpose utility functions used throughout the project.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd trading-dashboard-pro
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure all required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    If the application uses API keys or other sensitive information, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add them there. Example:
    ```env
    API_KEY="your_api_key"
    ANOTHER_SETTING="value"
    ```
    The application should be configured to load these using a library like `python-dotenv`.

## ▶️ Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
The application should then be accessible in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.🎨 Styling and ThemingCustom CSS: The application's appearance is customized using style.css. This file contains rules to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.Streamlit Theming: The .streamlit/config.toml file can be used to define base themes (light/dark), primary colors, fonts, etc., for Streamlit's native components. Example:[theme]
primaryColor="#F63366"
backgroundColor="#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#F0F2F6"
textColor="#262730"
font="sans serif"
For a dark theme:[theme]
primaryColor="#F63366"
backgroundColor="#0E1117"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#262730"
textColor="#FAFAFA"
font="sans serif"
The application defaults to a dark theme as per user preference.📝 LoggingThe application utilizes a centralized logging system configured in utils/logger.py. This helps in:Tracking application flow and events.Debugging errors and issues.Monitoring performance and potential bottlenecks.Logs should be reviewed for troubleshooting and operational insights.💡 Potential Future EnhancementsDatabase Integration: For more robust data storage and retrieval of trade history and user notes.Real-time Data Feeds: Integration with brokers or data providers for live market data.Advanced Backtesting Engine: More sophisticated backtesting capabilities with parameter optimization.User Authentication: Secure access for multiple users.Automated Reporting: Generation of PDF or email reports.Enhanced AI/ML Features: More predictive models, anomaly detection, or sentiment analysis.Test Suite: Implementation of unit and integration tests (/tests/ directory) for ensuring code quality and reliability.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
