        After uploading your CSV, you will be prompted to **map your CSV columns** to the fields the application expects.
        This step is crucial for the dashboard to understand your data correctly.

        **How it Works:**
        * **Data Preview:** The mapping interface will show the first few rows of your uploaded CSV to help you identify your columns.
        * **Application Fields (Left):** On the left, you'll see a list of data fields the application needs (e.g., "{CONCEPTUAL_COLUMNS.get('date', 'Date/Time')}", "{CONCEPTUAL_COLUMNS.get('pnl', 'Profit/Loss')}"). Critical fields required for basic operation are marked with an asterisk (`*`).
        * **Your CSV Columns (Right):** For each application field, select the corresponding column header from *your* CSV file using the dropdown menu.
        * **Auto-Mapping Attempt:** The system will try to automatically suggest mappings based on common names and synonyms. **Please review these suggestions carefully.**
        * **Data Type Warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è):** If the system detects a potential mismatch between the data type of your selected CSV column and what the application expects for a field (e.g., you map a text column to a numeric PnL field), a warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) will appear. Please pay close attention to these warnings.
        * **Confirmation:** Once you've mapped all necessary columns (especially critical ones), click "Confirm Column Mapping" to proceed.

        * **Critical Fields Error:** If you see an error like "Critical fields not mapped," ensure you've selected a CSV column for all fields marked with `*` (e.g., Date, PnL).
        * **Duplicate Critical Mapping Error:** Each critical application field (like 'Date', 'PnL') must be mapped to a *unique* column from your CSV. You cannot map the same CSV column to two different critical fields.

This is normal if your CSV doesn't contain that specific information.
